# **QuizWeaver Feature Backlog & Roadmap**

This document tracks the planned features and enhancements for the QuizWeaver suite.

## **🟢 Epic 1: The "Smart" Retake (Immediate Enhancements)**

*Focus: Improving the pedagogical quality of the generated assessments.*

* \[ \] **Scaffolding Toggle / Difficulty Slider**
  * **Description:** Allow teachers to generate a "Version B" of a test that covers the same SOL standards but uses simplified vocabulary or breaks complex questions into steps.
  * **User Value:** Helps students who are struggling without removing the rigor of the concept.
  * **Technical:** Inject "complexity constraints" into the Generator Agent's prompt.
* \[ \] **Automatic "Rationales" (Study Guide Key)**
  * **Description:** The system should output a separate PDF "Study Guide" where every question includes an explanation of *why* the correct answer is right and why the distractors are wrong.
  * **User Value:** Saves teachers hours of writing explanations for remediation.
  * **Technical:** Update the output schema to include rationale fields for every option.
* \[ \] **Gap Analysis (Coverage Report)**
  * **Description:** A report generated by the Critic Agent that compares the generated quiz against the source material.
  * **Output Example:** "This quiz covers 80% of 'Cell\_Division.pdf', but misses 'Cytokinesis'."
  * **User Value:** Gives teachers confidence that they aren't missing critical standards.

## **🔵 Epic 2: The "Science Specialist"**

*Focus: Features specific to science instruction and visual learning.*

* \[ \] **Lab-to-Question Engine**
  * **Description:** A specialized input mode where the teacher describes a hands-on lab (e.g., "Strawberry DNA Extraction"). The AI generates application questions referencing specific materials used (detergent, ethanol).
  * **User Value:** Connects abstract test questions to concrete classroom memories.
* \[ \] **Visual Diagram Generator (Multimodal)**
  * **Description:** Use the Generator Agent (via Gemini/DALL-E) to create *new*, unlabeled scientific diagrams for "label the parts" questions.
  * **User Value:** Prevents students from just memorizing the textbook image; tests true recognition.

## **🟣 Epic 3: Workflow & Integration (The "Admin Killer")**

*Focus: Reducing administrative overhead and click-work.*

* \[ \] **IEP Compliance Mode**
  * **Description:** A CLI/UI flag (--iep) that auto-generates a compliant version of the test:
    * Reduces answer choices from 4 to 3\.
    * Simplifies sentence structure.
    * Increases font size.
  * **User Value:** Instantly meets legal requirements for accommodations without manual editing.
* \[ \] **Canvas Integration (LMS Sync)**
  * **Description:** Direct API integration to push the QTI zip file straight to a Canvas course.
  * **Technical:** Use canvasapi python library to authenticate and upload assignments.

## **🟡 Epic 4: The "Weaver" Suite (Future Vision)**

*Focus: Expanding the product lifecycle.*

* \[ \] **PlanWeaver (Pre-Teaching)**
  * Input: SOL Standards.
  * Output: Lesson plan outlines aligned to those standards.
* \[ \] **GradeWeaver (Post-Assessment)**
  * Input: Student result data (CSV export from Canvas).
  * Output: "Re-teach Report" identifying which specific concepts the class failed.

## **🛠 Technical Debt & Chore List**

* \[ \] **Refine Critic Agent Prompts:** Tighten the rubric for "negative constraints" (what the AI *shouldn't* do).
* \[ \] **Database Migration System:** As we add new features (like rationales), we need Alembic for DB schema migrations.
* \[ \] **Frontend UI:** Eventually move from CLI to a simple Web Interface (Streamlit or React).
