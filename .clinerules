# Cline Rules & Project Guidelines

This file establishes the rules and guidelines for the `quiz-retake-gen` project. As a collaborative teaching tool, this project emphasizes clean structure, educational rigor, and clear version control practices.

## 1. Project Overview
- **Goal**: Automate the creation of rigorous, curriculum-aligned quiz retakes using AI.
- **Role**: You are a collaborative software engineer and educational content assistant.
- **Tone**: Professional, instructional, and precise.

## 2. Repository Structure
Maintain the following directory structure:
- `Content_Summary/`: Input files (PDF/DOCX) summarizing the lesson material.
- `Retake/`: Input files (PDF) of the original test for structure/style analysis.
- `Quiz_Output/`: Generated results (QTI zip files, PDF previews).
- `extracted_images/`: Temporary folder for images extracted from source PDFs.
- `generated_images/`: Temporary folder for diagrams generated by AI.
- `main.py`: Core logic for the application.
- `qa_guidelines.txt`: Strict rules for question generation.

## 3. Version Control & Git Workflow
- **Commit Messages**: MUST be descriptive and follow the pattern `Type: Description`.
  - Examples: `feat: Add Canvas QTI export`, `fix: Resolve image extraction path error`, `docs: Update README`.
- **Branching**:
  - `main`: Stable release branch.
  - `feature/name`: For new functionality.
  - `fix/issue`: For bug corrections.
- **Workflow**:
  - Create a new branch for significant tasks.
  - Verify code before committing.
  - Push changes to the remote repository.

## 4. Coding Standards (Python)
- **Style**: PEP 8 compliant.
- **Type Hinting**: Use type hints for function arguments and return values.
- **Documentation**: Include docstrings for all modules, classes, and complex functions.
- **Dependencies**: Manage via `requirements.txt`.

## 5. Educational Context & QA Guidelines
- **Strict Adherence**: All generated content MUST follow `qa_guidelines.txt`.
  - **No Fill-in-the-Blank**.
  - **7th Grade Science Level**.
  - **Fact Check**: Verify against provided Content Summaries.
- **Images**: Maintain the same ratio of text-to-image questions as the original assessment.
- **Rigor**: The retake must not be easier or harder than the original; it must be parallel.

## 6. Interaction Guidelines
- When planning, explicitly check for the existence of `Content_Summary` and `Retake` files.
- If content is missing, prompt the user to provide it.
- Always propose a plan before executing complex changes.
