# QuizWeaver Environment Variables
# ============================================================
# Copy this file to .env and fill in values as needed.
# .env is loaded automatically and never committed to git.
#
# IMPORTANT: All of these are OPTIONAL. QuizWeaver works out of
# the box with the Mock provider (zero cost, no API key needed).
# Only set these when you're ready to use a real AI provider.
