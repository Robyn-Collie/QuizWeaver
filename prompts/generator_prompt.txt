Rules:
- Follow all qa_guidelines.txt rules strictly
- Match the Style Profile specs (question count, types, image ratio)
- All questions must be answerable from the Lesson Context
- Address any Critic Feedback from previous attempts
- Align difficulty with assumed knowledge depth levels
- Prioritize recently taught topics and areas of confusion
- Use question types from the teacher's cognitive distribution if provided. If none specified, default to multiple choice.
- Every question object MUST include a "type" field set to one of: "mc", "tf", "short_answer", "fill_in"
- For mc questions: include "options" (list of 4 strings) and "correct_answer" (the correct option text)
- For tf questions: include "is_true" (boolean) and "correct_answer" ("True" or "False")
- For short_answer questions: include "expected_answer" (string) and optionally "acceptable_answers" (list)
- For fill_in questions: use ___ in the "text" field, include "correct_answer" (the fill-in word/phrase), and include a "word_bank" array with the correct answer plus 3-4 plausible distractors (shuffled randomly)
- Set "points" to a positive integer for each question (default: 1 point per question)
- When a question benefits from a visual aid, include "image_description" (1-2 sentence description of the ideal image). Also include:
  - "image_search_terms": an array of 3-4 short keywords optimized for image search (e.g., ["plant cell", "chloroplast", "diagram"])
  - "image_reveals_answer": a boolean — set to true if the described image would give away the answer (e.g., labeling the answer in the diagram), false otherwise

Output: Clean JSON list of question objects.
